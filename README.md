# Stage-Mage
This is the collection of code for my capstone project.
Stage-Mage is an event posting and tracking web-based application.
There is still a lot of work to be done before it is consumer ready. 
The idea came from a need that my local theatre community had. 
Our events often got lost in the sea of events happening out there,
and often theatres would cross schedule events and audiences were left to choose where to go on which day.
The end goal of this applicaiton is to allow the theatres, and local performers to put their events in one central space,
and also allow patrons to have access to the events, subscribe to theatres and events,
and keep track of all the cool things happening in our local community.
Right now it's a very basci event tracking app that lets users creat an account, and subscribe to events already on the app.
This app has not been launched or hosted anywhere yet.
A big thanks to AJ at HTML5Up for the template.
